            <p>My name is Carolyn Campbell. Born and raised in San Luis Obispo and recently returned from living in the pacific
                northwest, I am a person of diverse interests and talents:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="emphasis">classical music:</span> I began choral singing and classical piano studies at age 6, both of which
                        progressed to advanced levels through college and beyond. I've had the privelege to perform in Carnegie
                        Hall, conduct my high school choirs, perform piano accompaniments, write musical arrangements for
                        my college a cappella group and a handbell ensemble, collaborate with concert pianists in an 8-piano
                        piece, perform at the national and international level, and am currently teaching myself to play
                        mandolin.</li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="emphasis">psychology:</span> my undergraduate education focused around neuroscience, sensation/perception,
                        and cognition. I am fascinated with how individual humans/animals percieve unique worlds due to different
                        physiologies, biases, and emotional landscapes.</li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="emphasis">making a difference:</span> I feel helping others is part of my purpose. In high school I worked
                        1:1 with Deaf children at a speech-pathology summer camp, and after college I implemented Applied
                        Behavior Analysis in my work with students with severe autism. I'm interested in issues of accessibility
                        and disability identity.</li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="emphasis">animals and nature:</span> my calm/patient demeaner make me good with animals. I adopted my dog Riley
                        in 2017 while living in Seattle; as a rescue with a traumatic past, I've been utilizing behavior
                        analytics in her training/rehabilitation. I love sharing adventures with her out in nature, through
                        hiking, trail running, and camping.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>What makes me me?</h3>
            <p class="qualities">creative ~ intelligent ~ curious ~ thoughtful ~ calm ~ independent ~ analytical ~ compassionate</p>
            <p class="balance">Balance for me means striving for wellness through relationships with friends/family, lifelong learning,
                <br>exploring new recipes, making time for my dog, yoga, and creative pursuits.</p>

            <p>I'm interested in machine learning as applied to sensory prosthetics, navigation devices for people who are visually
                impaired, and speech devices for people who are nonverbal. I'm curious as to how cochlear implants could
                be situationally flexible for optimal music listening vs. speech recognition. I want to help people with
                disabilities be more empowered and autonomous in their daily lives.
